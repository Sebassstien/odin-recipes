This project, part of The Odin Project, involves creating a cooking recipes website using HTML. In this project, I will showcase my ability to build a simple yet effective HTML site, incorporating secure relative links that connect to other websites.

At this stage, the website will be built using HTML only, with plans to enhance it further with CSS and JavaScript in the future.
